Location-Based Reminder Web AppThis is a web application built with Python and Flask that serves as a personal "location memory assistant." It solves the common problem of forgetting which stores or places are good for specific needs. Users can create an account, save their favorite locations with custom tags (e.g., "Central Coffee Shop" with tags "good wifi, coffee"), and later get reminders or suggestions based on their location.The core idea is to build a personal, curated map of places that matter to the user, moving beyond a generic search engine.Key FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure user registration and login system with password hashing.Protected Dashboard: A personal dashboard page is only accessible to logged-in users.Save Real Locations: Users can save places by:Searching for a real-world address using the Google Places Autocomplete API.Using their device's live GPS position to save their current location.Custom Tagging: Users can add their own descriptive tags to each saved place.View Saved Places: The dashboard displays a list of all places the user has saved.Technology StackBackend: Python with the Flask web framework.Database: PostgreSQL for data storage, chosen for its powerful geospatial capabilities (using the PostGIS extension).Database ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the database using Python objects.Frontend: Standard HTML5 with the Jinja2 templating engine.APIs:Google Maps Places API for address search.Google Maps Geocoding API for converting coordinates to addresses.Browser Geolocation API for getting the user's live location.How to Run This Project LocallyClone the repository.Set up the environment:Make sure you have Python 3.11+ and PostgreSQL installed.Create a Python virtual environment: py -m venv venvActivate it: .\venv\Scripts\activateInstall dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt (Note: You would first need to create this file with pip freeze > requirements.txt)Set up the database:Create a PostgreSQL database and a user with login permissions.Update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI in app.py with your credentials.Create the database tables:Run flask shell.Inside the shell, run from app import db and then db.create_all().Run the application:python app.pyAccess the website:Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
